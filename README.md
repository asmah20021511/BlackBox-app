# BlackBox-app
This app was built to show how our idea   "The Black Box" app would look and work. It is meant to be a working prototype for the Volkswagen i.mobilothon.3.0 competition. You will find an apk as well as the app's java and xml codes.
To get the full potential of the application we need the data from the OBD-II ports and EDR but due to the unavailabilty of the hardware , we just tried to show how the app interface will look to the user by adding dummy data.
